        We are bringing completely new experience for people hosting and
        attending various types of events. We do this by analyzing their
        personalities and characteristics and putting them together with people
        of similar interests. Doing this we try to improve networking among
        people.

        This platform is intended to make event-hosters' job easier. This is
        done through our effective usage of special algorithms that gather
        information about the attendees from their activity on social networks.
        If this is not available, we suggest the attendees to take a
        questionnaire on their interests and characteristics after which we can
        implement our algorithms to match these people and arrange them seats
        with people close to their interests.
